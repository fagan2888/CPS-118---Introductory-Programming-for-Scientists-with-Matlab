# CPS-118---Introductory-Programming-for-Scientists-with-Matlab
My final group project for a MATLAB course I took in the Fall of 2015. The project is based on analyzing the temperatures of The Great Lakes. Since this was a first year class on MATLAB, the code setup was probably not the most efficient in analyzing the data. MATLAB has built in functions and tools to better analyze the data. \ 
• Worked in a team of 3 to develop a term project that studied annual mean temperatures of 5 Great Lakes of Ontario \
• The dataset, formatted in Excel and extracted by MATLAB, was summarized in 7 ways: tables, pie charts, combined line charts, polynomial equations, etc... \
• The report, which scored a perfect 100%, required 607 lines of coding to illustrate the temperatures through multiple approaches
